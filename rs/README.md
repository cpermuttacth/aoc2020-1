This project builds with [Cargo](https://docs.rust-lang.org/cargo).

Until [`min_const_generics`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74878) is in stable Rust (estimated [1.50](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79135)), you will need to use Rust Nightly.

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup override set nightly
```

Print solutions for the inputs provided in local data files:

```sh
